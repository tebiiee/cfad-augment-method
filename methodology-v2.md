## üéØ How to Use CFAD 2.0

### Step 1: Specify Your Work Type
Tell the agent what you want to do:
```
"Let's start a new project" ‚Üí project-setup/ (4-phase UI-first)
"Let's add new features to this project" ‚Üí new-feature/ (3-phase UI-first)
"Let's fix some bugs" ‚Üí bug-fix/ (2-phase systematic)
"Let's optimize the code" ‚Üí refactor/ (3-phase safe)
"Let's improve the UI/UX" ‚Üí ui-work/ (3-phase design-first)
```

### Step 2: Automatic Input Processing
The agent will automatically:
1. **Read Project Inputs**: Process all files in `/docs/project-input/`
2. **Archive Inputs**: Move them to `/docs/archived/[timestamp]/` for future reference
3. **Select Workflow**: Choose appropriate workflow from `.augment/workflows/`
4. **Begin Methodology**: Start the enhanced multi-phase process (2-4 phases depending on workflow)

### Workflow Selection Process

1. **User Specifies Work Type**: You tell the agent what kind of work to do
2. **Input Processing**: Agent reads and archives project inputs
3. **Workflow Selection**: Agent selects appropriate workflow file
4. **Role Assignment**: Agent assumes correct role from `.augment/agents/`
5. **Rule Application**: Agent applies standards from `.augment/rules/`
6. **Context Maintenance**: Agent updates `.augment/context/` throughout

### Supported Work Types

| Work Type | Workflow File | Agent Flow | Description |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **New Project** | `project-setup/` | PM ‚Üí Designer ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | Complete project setup with 4-phase UI-first approach |
| **New Features** | `new-feature/` | PM ‚Üí Designer ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | Add functionality with 3-phase UI-first approach |
| **Bug Fixes** | `bug-fix/` | PM ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | Investigation and resolution with 2-phase systematic approach |
| **Code Optimization** | `refactor/` | PM ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | Safe code improvement with 3-phase approach |
| **UI/UX Work** | `ui-work/` | Designer ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA | Interface implementation with 3-phase design-first approach |

**Note**: DevOps agent activates automatically for complex projects requiring advanced infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, IaC).

## üîÑ Enhanced Multi-Phase Process

### **PHASE 1: INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS** ‚è±Ô∏è ~10-15 minutes

**Auto-Detection & Setup**:
- ‚úÖ Detect project type and existing state
- ‚úÖ Configure `.augment/` structure automatically
- ‚úÖ Set up appropriate MCPs based on detected stack
- ‚úÖ Initialize context files with project analysis

**Context Establishment**:
- ‚úÖ Create `.augment/context/mission.md` with project goals
- ‚úÖ Generate `.augment/rules/` based on detected patterns
- ‚úÖ Configure GitHub Actions and CI/CD automatically
- ‚úÖ Set up QA tools (Playwright, testing frameworks)

### **PHASE 2: SPEC-DRIVEN PLANNING** ‚è±Ô∏è ~20-30 minutes

**Enhanced Planning Process**:
- ‚úÖ Create hyper-detailed stories with acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Design technical specifications with API contracts
- ‚úÖ Break down into granular, trackable tasks
- ‚úÖ Establish verification criteria for each story
- ‚úÖ Update `.augment/context/roadmap.md` with sprint plan

**Quality Gates**:
- ‚úÖ All stories have clear acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Technical specs include API design and database changes
- ‚úÖ Task dependencies are clearly mapped
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline is green before proceeding

### **PHASE 3: WORKFLOW-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION** ‚è±Ô∏è Variable

**Intelligent Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-select appropriate workflow based on task type
- ‚úÖ Follow role-specific guidelines for each phase
- ‚úÖ Implement with TDD when appropriate
- ‚úÖ Use visual feedback loops for UI work
- ‚úÖ Maintain continuous integration and testing

**Progress Tracking**:
- ‚úÖ Update task states in real-time
- ‚úÖ Document decisions in `.augment/context/decisions.md`
- ‚úÖ Maintain green CI/CD pipeline throughout
- ‚úÖ Verify each story against acceptance criteria

## üß† Smart Context Management

### Context Strategy & Usage
```markdown
## Context Files Purpose:
- `.augment/context/mission.md` - Project vision, goals, constraints (ALWAYS read at phase start)
- `.augment/context/roadmap.md` - Current progress, sprint status, next steps
- `.augment/context/decisions.md` - Key architectural and business decisions

## When to Read Context:
- **Phase Start**: Always read mission.md for project alignment
- **Agent Handoff**: Read relevant context for continuity
- **Decision Making**: Check decisions.md for previous choices
- **Sprint Planning**: Read roadmap.md for current state

## When to Update Context:
- **After Research**: Update mission.md with new insights
- **After Decisions**: Document in decisions.md with rationale
- **Sprint Changes**: Update roadmap.md with progress
- **Major Milestones**: Refresh all context files
```

### Cascading Context Loading
```markdown
# Example: Phase 2 start (after research)
1. Load: .augment/context/mission.md (project vision - UPDATED with research)
2. Load: /docs/research/product-definition.md (research output - INPUT for this phase)
3. Load: .augment/workflows/project-setup/phase-2-research.md (current workflow phase)
4. Load: .augment/agents/architect.md (role for current phase)
5. Skip: Individual research files (use synthesized product-definition.md instead)
```

### Context Optimization
- **Summarized Context**: Context files are executive summaries, not detailed docs
- **Research Artifacts**: Detailed research in `/docs/research/` used as phase inputs
- **Git Context Lineage**: Use commit history to understand evolution
- **Memory Persistence**: Use Agent Memories for session continuity
- **Conditional Loading**: Only load files relevant to current task

## üöÄ Advanced Features

#### **Rules Creation Process:**
1. **Phase 1 Step 6**: Architect analyzes project requirements
2. **Template Usage**: Uses `.augment/methodology/dynamic-rules.md` templates
3. **Rule Generation**: Creates project-tech-stack.md, project-conventions.md, project-quality.md
4. **Integration**: Updates main.md to reference new project-specific rules
5. **Validation**: Ensures rules align with chosen technology stack and project needs
