# Augment Develop Method: Code Refactor Workflow - Phase 1: Overview

## 🎯 Phase Purpose
Understand the complete code refactoring workflow structure, agent roles, and phase navigation before beginning refactoring analysis.

## 📍 Phase Navigation
- **Previous**: Workflow Selection ✅
- **Current**: Phase 1 - Overview 🔄
- **Next**: Phase 2 - Code Analysis (`phase-2-analysis.md`)

---

## 📋 Workflow Structure

### **Total Phases**: 3 phases
### **Estimated Time**: 2-7 days (depends on refactor scope)
### **Agent Flow**: Project Manager → Architect/Developer → Developer/QA

```
Phase 1: Overview → Phase 2: Code Analysis → Phase 3: Implementation
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Understanding → Code Assessment & Planning → Safe Implementation
```

## 🔄 **Phase Navigation**

### **➡️ Phase 2**: Code Analysis & Planning
**File**: `phase-2-analysis.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive code analysis and refactoring strategy planning
**Duration**: ~1-2 days
**Agent**: Project Manager, Architect, Developer

### **➡️ Phase 3**: Safe Implementation & Validation
**File**: `phase-3-implementation.md`
**Purpose**: Incremental refactoring with continuous testing and validation
**Duration**: ~2-5 days (depends on scope)
**Agents**: Developer, QA, Project Manager

## 📋 **Key Deliverables by Phase**

### **Phase 1 Output**:
- ✅ Complete code analysis and quality assessment
- ✅ Refactoring opportunities and priorities identified
- ✅ Impact analysis and risk assessment
- ✅ User approval for refactoring approach

### **Phase 2 Output**:
- ✅ Detailed refactoring plan and strategy
- ✅ Safety measures and rollback procedures
- ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy
- ✅ User approval for implementation plan

### **Phase 3 Output**:
- ✅ **Code successfully refactored** with improved quality
- ✅ All functionality preserved and validated
- ✅ Complete verification documentation
- ✅ User approval for refactoring completion

## 🎭 **Agent Role Declaration Protocol**

### **MANDATORY for Every Interaction**:
```markdown
🎭 **I am acting as [Agent Role]** for [specific task/phase]
```

---

## 🚨 **Critical Success Factors**

### **Quality Gates**
- **Phase 1**: Code analysis complete, refactoring scope approved
- **Phase 2**: Refactoring plan validated, safety measures in place
- **Phase 3**: Refactoring complete, all tests passing, no functionality lost

### **Safety Principles**
- **Preserve Functionality**: No breaking changes to existing behavior
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable refactoring steps
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests pass at every step
- **Rollback Ready**: Easy rollback if issues arise
