## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: UI-First Sprint Setup & Development Preparation (Project Manager)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for UI-first sprint setup and development preparation

## UI-First Sprint Initialization:
- [ ] Read `.augment/context/mission.md` for project alignment
- [ ] Read `.augment/context/roadmap.md` for sprint status
- [ ] Create `/docs/verification/sprint-1a/`, `/docs/verification/sprint-1b/`, `/docs/verification/sprint-1c/` directories
- [ ] Ensure `/docs/stories/sprint-1a/` structure is ready for Sprint 1A (Visual Foundation)
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline is green and ready for UI-first development
- [ ] Verify UI-first development environment is configured (Storybook, design tools)
- [ ] Load all stories from `/docs/stories/sprint-1a/` (starting with Visual Foundation)
- [ ] Organize UI-first stories by dependencies and execution order
- [ ] Identify parallel UI development opportunities

## UI-First Development Strategy Setup:
- [ ] Plan UI-first story execution sequence: 1A ‚Üí 1B ‚Üí 1C
- [ ] Set up UI-first feature branch workflow (feature/ui-story-[ID]-[name])
- [ ] Prepare development environment for UI-first TDD approach
- [ ] Verify all testing frameworks are ready (Jest, Playwright, visual regression)
- [ ] Set up design system development tools and workflow
- [ ] Configure mock data and API mocking for UI development phase
- [ ] Document UI-first development approach and quality standards

## Sprint Phase Planning:
- [ ] **Sprint 1A (Week 1-2)**: Visual Foundation - Design system, static screens, navigation
- [ ] **Sprint 1B (Week 3-4)**: Interactive UI - Forms, state management, mock data
- [ ] **Sprint 1C (Week 5-6)**: Backend Integration - APIs, database, authentication

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Setup: Initialize Sprint 1 development environment"
- [ ] Create task: "Planning: Organize story execution sequence"
- [ ] Create task for EACH story: "Develop: Story [ID] - [Name]"
- [ ] Update tasks to IN_PROGRESS as development begins

## Quality Gate:

- [ ] Verify all stories are loaded and understood
- [ ] Verify development environment is ready
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline is green
```

### **Step 2: UI-First Story-by-Story Development Cycle (Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Project Manager)**

```markdown
## üîÑ FOR EACH STORY in current sprint phase execution order:

üé≠ **Role transitions for each story**: Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Project Manager

### UI-First Story Development (Developer)
üé≠ **I am acting as Developer** for UI-First Story [ID] implementation

- [ ] Use Codebase Retrieval to understand existing patterns and design system
- [ ] Create UI-first feature branch: `feature/ui-story-[ID]-[name]`
- [ ] Read story file completely from current sprint: `/docs/stories/sprint-1a/story-[ID]-[name].md` (or 1b/1c)
- [ ] Implement UI-first TDD approach (UI tests first, then implementation)
- [ ] Follow project-specific rules, conventions, and design system guidelines
- [ ] Use Context7 for framework documentation when needed
- [ ] Focus implementation on current sprint phase:
  - **Sprint 1A**: Visual components, static screens, navigation, responsive design
  - **Sprint 1B**: Interactive elements, state management, mock data integration
  - **Sprint 1C**: Backend integration, real data, authentication, production features
- [ ] Make intermediate commits for risky changes or major milestones
- [ ] Use Augment Code checkpoints for complex UI implementations

### UI-First TDD Implementation Process:
1. **Red Phase**: Write UI tests first (visual, interaction, or integration based on sprint phase)
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum UI code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve UI code quality and design system consistency
4. **Integration**: Ensure UI feature integrates with existing design system and architecture

- [ ] Execute E2E tests with Playwright for user flows (current sprint phase)
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met with UI-first focus
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios for current sprint phase
- [ ] Validate UI performance requirements (load times, animations)
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- [ ] Verify design system consistency and component reusability
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline is green with UI-first deployment
