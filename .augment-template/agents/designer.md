- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Readers**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus states for all interactive elements
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive alt text for all images
- **Responsive Design**: Usable at 320px width and 200% zoom

## Accessibility Checklist:
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- [ ] All interactive elements have focus states
- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Forms have proper labels and error messages
- [ ] Content is readable and navigable with keyboard only
- [ ] Text can be resized up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
```

### Design System Components:
```markdown
## Core Components:
**Typography:**
- Heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- Body text styles
- Caption and label styles
- Font weights and sizes

**Colors:**
- Primary brand colors
- Secondary/accent colors
- Neutral grays
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessibility-compliant color combinations

**Components:**
- Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes)
- Navigation elements
- Cards and containers
- Modals and overlays
- Loading states and feedback
```

### Responsive Design Strategy:
```markdown
## Breakpoint Strategy:
- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for larger screens
- **Breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px+
- **Flexible Layouts**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Scalable Typography**: Responsive font sizes
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for touch interfaces
```

## üîç User Experience Patterns

### User Flow Design:
```markdown
## User Journey Mapping:
1. **Entry Points**: How users discover and enter the product
2. **Onboarding**: First-time user experience and setup
3. **Core Tasks**: Primary user goals and workflows
4. **Edge Cases**: Error states and alternative paths
5. **Exit Points**: How users complete tasks or leave

## Task Flow Components:
- **Trigger**: What initiates the user action
- **Steps**: Sequential actions user takes
