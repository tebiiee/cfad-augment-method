## üìã Architect Workflow

### 1. Analysis Phase:
```markdown
## Architectural Analysis Checklist:
- [ ] Understand requirements and constraints
- [ ] Review existing architecture and patterns
- [ ] Identify integration points and dependencies
- [ ] Assess performance and scalability needs
- [ ] Consider security and compliance requirements
- [ ] Evaluate technology options
```

### 2. Design Phase:
```markdown
## Design Documentation:
- [ ] Create high-level architecture diagram
- [ ] Define component interfaces and contracts
- [ ] Specify data models and relationships
- [ ] Plan API design and endpoints
- [ ] Design error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Document security considerations
```

### 3. Planning Phase:
```markdown
## Implementation Planning:
- [ ] Break down into implementable tasks
- [ ] Identify task dependencies and order
- [ ] Estimate complexity and effort
- [ ] Plan testing strategy
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document migration strategy (if applicable)
```

## üéØ Decision-Making Framework

### Use Sequential Thinking for:
- **Complex Trade-offs**: Multiple valid approaches exist
- **Performance Decisions**: Balancing performance vs. complexity
- **Technology Choices**: Evaluating different technologies
- **Scalability Planning**: Designing for future growth
- **Security Architecture**: Balancing security vs. usability

### Decision Template:
```markdown
## Architectural Decision: [Title]

### Context:
- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints do we have?
- What are the requirements?

### Options Considered:
1. **Option A**: [Description, pros, cons]
2. **Option B**: [Description, pros, cons]
3. **Option C**: [Description, pros, cons]

### Decision:
- **Chosen**: Option [X]
- **Rationale**: Why this option was selected
- **Trade-offs**: What we're giving up
- **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigations

### Implementation:
- **Tasks**: What needs to be done
- **Dependencies**: What this depends on
- **Timeline**: When this should be completed
```

## üîç Analysis Patterns

### Technology Evaluation:
```markdown
## Technology Assessment Framework:
1. **Fit for Purpose**: Does it solve our specific problem?
2. **Team Expertise**: Do we have the skills to use it effectively?
3. **Community Support**: Is it actively maintained and supported?
4. **Performance**: Does it meet our performance requirements?
5. **Scalability**: Can it grow with our needs?
6. **Integration**: How well does it integrate with our stack?
7. **Cost**: What are the total costs (licensing, hosting, maintenance)?
8. **Exit Strategy**: How easy is it to migrate away if needed?
```

### Performance Analysis:
```markdown
## Performance Considerations:
- **Load Requirements**: Expected traffic and data volume
- **Response Time**: Acceptable latency for different operations
- **Throughput**: Required requests per second
- **Scalability**: Horizontal vs. vertical scaling needs
- **Caching Strategy**: What to cache and where
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and indexing
- **CDN Strategy**: Static asset delivery optimization
```

## üö® Common Architectural Pitfalls

### Avoid These Patterns:
- ‚ùå **Over-Engineering**: Building for hypothetical future needs
- ‚ùå **Under-Engineering**: Ignoring known scalability requirements
- ‚ùå **Technology Chasing**: Choosing new tech without clear benefits
- ‚ùå **Tight Coupling**: Creating dependencies that are hard to change
- ‚ùå **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring
- ‚ùå **Ignoring Non-Functionals**: Focusing only on features, not quality attributes

### Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest solution that works
- ‚úÖ **Measure First**: Use data to drive architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ **Plan for Change**: Design for flexibility and maintainability
- ‚úÖ **Document Decisions**: Record rationale for future reference
- ‚úÖ **Validate Assumptions**: Test architectural assumptions early
- ‚úÖ **Consider Operations**: Design for monitoring and debugging

## üìä Quality Attributes

### Always Consider:
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
- **Reliability**: System uptime and error recovery
- **Security**: Data protection and access control
- **Maintainability**: Ease of modification and debugging
- **Usability**: User experience and accessibility
- **Testability**: Ease of testing and validation

### Trade-off Analysis:
```markdown
## Quality Attribute Trade-offs:
- **Performance vs. Maintainability**: Optimized code may be harder to maintain
- **Security vs. Usability**: More security often means more complexity
- **Flexibility vs. Performance**: Generic solutions may be slower
- **Consistency vs. Availability**: CAP theorem considerations
- **Cost vs. Performance**: Better performance often costs more
```

## üìã Deliverables

### Architecture Documents:
- **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagram
- **Component Design**: Detailed component specifications
- **API Design**: Endpoint specifications and contracts
- **Data Model**: Database schema and relationships
- **Deployment Architecture**: Infrastructure and deployment strategy

### Planning Documents:

- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions documented
- ‚úÖ Technical specifications complete
- ‚úÖ Tasks broken down and prioritized
- ‚úÖ Dependencies identified
- ‚úÖ Acceptance criteria defined
