apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        env:
        - name: NODE_ENV
          value: "production"
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"

  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  name     = "main-cluster"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.cluster.arn
  version  = "1.24"

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = aws_subnet.private[*].id
  }

  depends_on = [
