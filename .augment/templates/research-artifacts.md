## 📋 Usage Guidelines

### For Agents:
1. **Use templates as starting point** - Customize based on project specifics
2. **Fill all sections** - Even if brief, provide some content for each section
3. **Be specific and actionable** - Avoid vague statements
4. **Cross-reference** - Reference other research artifacts when relevant
5. **Commit after completion** - Each artifact gets its own commit

### For Context Management:
- **Research artifacts** are detailed documentation for reference
- **Context files** are executive summaries for quick agent consumption
- **Use research as input** for subsequent phases, not context files
- **Update context** after major research findings

### Quality Standards:
- **Actionable**: Each artifact should enable next phase decisions
- **Evidence-based**: Include sources and reasoning
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all relevant aspects thoroughly
- **Consistent**: Use same format and quality across all artifacts
