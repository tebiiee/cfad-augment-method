- [ ] Run test suite to confirm failure
```

#### Step 2: Bug Fix Implementation
```markdown
## Fix Implementation:
- [ ] Implement minimal fix to make tests pass

- [ ] Verify no new issues introduced
- [ ] Test in different environments
- [ ] Validate performance impact
```

**Deliverables**:
- Bug fix implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Validation that bug is resolved
- No regression in existing functionality

### **PHASE 4: QUALITY ASSURANCE**
**Agent Role**: QA (`.augment/agents/qa.md`)

#### Step 1: Fix Verification
```markdown
## QA Verification:
- [ ] Verify bug is fixed using original reproduction steps
- [ ] Test edge cases and variations
- [ ] Verify fix works across different browsers/devices
- [ ] Test related functionality for regression
- [ ] Validate user experience improvements
```

#### Step 2: Regression Testing
```markdown
## Regression Testing:
- [ ] Run automated regression test suite
- [ ] Test related features manually
- [ ] Verify integration points still work
- [ ] Check for performance regressions
- [ ] Validate security hasn't been compromised
```

#### Step 3: Acceptance Testing
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Original issue is resolved
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] User experience is improved
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
```

**Deliverables**:
- QA validation report
- Regression test results
- Performance impact assessment
- Approval for deployment

---

### **PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT & MONITORING**
**Agent Role**: Coordinator (`.augment/agents/coordinator.md`)

#### Step 1: Deployment Planning
```markdown
## Deployment Strategy:
- [ ] Plan deployment timing (consider user impact)
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Set up monitoring for the fix
- [ ] Communicate fix to stakeholders
- [ ] Plan post-deployment validation
```

#### Step 2: Deployment Execution
```markdown
## Deployment Process:
- [ ] Deploy fix to staging environment
- [ ] Validate fix in staging
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor deployment process
- [ ] Verify fix works in production
```

#### Step 3: Post-Deployment Monitoring
```markdown
## Monitoring Checklist:
- [ ] Monitor error rates and logs
- [ ] Check user feedback and reports
- [ ] Validate business metrics
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Confirm no new issues reported
```

**Deliverables**:
- Successfully deployed fix
- Monitoring data showing resolution
- Stakeholder communication
- Lessons learned documentation

## üö® Severity-Based Workflows

### Critical Bugs (P1):
```markdown
## Critical Bug Process:
- **Timeline**: Fix within 2-4 hours
- **Process**: Skip non-essential steps, focus on immediate fix
- **Testing**: Minimal testing, deploy hotfix, comprehensive testing after
- **Communication**: Immediate stakeholder notification
- **Rollback**: Have immediate rollback plan ready
```

### High Priority Bugs (P2):
```markdown
## High Priority Process:
- **Timeline**: Fix within 1-2 days
- **Process**: Follow full workflow but expedited
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
- **Communication**: Regular stakeholder updates
- **Rollback**: Standard rollback procedures
```

### Medium/Low Priority Bugs (P3/P4):
