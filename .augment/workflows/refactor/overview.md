# CFAD 2.0: Code Refactor Workflow

## 🎯 Workflow Purpose
Systematic code refactoring with comprehensive analysis, safe implementation, and thorough validation to improve code quality without breaking functionality.

## 📋 Workflow Structure

### **Total Phases**: 3 phases
### **Estimated Time**: 2-7 days (depends on refactor scope)
### **Agent Flow**: Project Manager → Architect/Developer → Developer/QA

```
Phase 1: Analysis → Phase 2: Planning → Phase 3: Implementation
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Code Assessment → Refactor Strategy → Safe Implementation
```

## 🎭 **Agent Role Declaration Protocol**

### **MANDATORY for Every Interaction**:
```markdown
🎭 **I am acting as [Agent Role]** for [specific task/phase]
```

---

## 🚨 **Critical Success Factors**

### **Quality Gates**
- **Phase 1**: Code analysis complete, refactoring scope approved
- **Phase 2**: Refactoring plan validated, safety measures in place
- **Phase 3**: Refactoring complete, all tests passing, no functionality lost

### **Safety Principles**
- **Preserve Functionality**: No breaking changes to existing behavior
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable refactoring steps
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests pass at every step
- **Rollback Ready**: Easy rollback if issues arise
