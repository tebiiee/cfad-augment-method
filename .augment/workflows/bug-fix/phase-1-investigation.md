## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Bug Analysis & Setup (Project Manager)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for bug investigation setup

## Bug Investigation Setup:
- [ ] Read bug report and gather all available information
- [ ] Assess bug priority and impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Create `/docs/bugs/bug-[ID]-[name]/` directory
- [ ] Set up Git branch for bug investigation: `bugfix/investigate-[ID]-[name]`
- [ ] Load relevant context about affected system components
- [ ] Use Codebase Retrieval to understand affected code areas

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Investigation: Bug [ID] analysis and reproduction"
- [ ] Create task: "Investigation: Root cause identification"
- [ ] Mark tasks as IN_PROGRESS when starting investigation

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "bug: initialize investigation for bug [ID] - [brief description]"
- [ ] Verify bug information is complete and understood
```

### **Step 2: Bug Reproduction & Analysis (Developer + QA)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Developer** working with QA for bug reproduction

## Bug Reproduction:
- [ ] Use Sequential Thinking for complex bug analysis
- [ ] Set up environment to reproduce the bug
- [ ] Follow provided reproduction steps exactly
- [ ] Document actual vs expected behavior
- [ ] Identify conditions that trigger the bug
- [ ] Test bug across different environments/browsers (if applicable)
- [ ] Document all reproduction scenarios and edge cases

## Root Cause Analysis:
- [ ] Use Codebase Retrieval to analyze affected code components
- [ ] Trace code execution path leading to the bug
- [ ] Identify the specific code or logic causing the issue
- [ ] Analyze recent changes that might have introduced the bug
- [ ] Check for similar issues in other parts of the codebase
- [ ] Assess impact on other system components

## Documentation:
- [ ] Create `/docs/bugs/bug-[ID]-[name]/investigation.md`
- [ ] Document reproduction steps and conditions
- [ ] Document root cause analysis findings
- [ ] Document affected system components
- [ ] Include code snippets and error logs

## Task Management:
- [ ] Mark investigation tasks as COMPLETE when:
  ‚úÖ Bug successfully reproduced
  ‚úÖ Root cause identified
  ‚úÖ Impact assessment complete
  ‚úÖ Documentation complete

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "bug: complete investigation for bug [ID] - root cause identified"
```

### **Step 3: Fix Strategy & Planning (Developer + Architect)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Developer** working with Architect for fix strategy

## Fix Strategy Development:
- [ ] Design fix approach based on root cause analysis
- [ ] Consider multiple solution alternatives
- [ ] Assess impact of proposed fix on existing functionality
- [ ] Plan testing strategy for the fix
- [ ] Identify potential side effects or risks
- [ ] Consider performance implications of the fix
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy if fix causes issues

## Implementation Planning:
- [ ] Break down fix into implementable steps
- [ ] Identify files and components that need modification
- [ ] Plan database changes (if applicable)
- [ ] Design test cases for fix validation
- [ ] Plan regression testing approach
- [ ] Estimate implementation effort and timeline

## Documentation:
- [ ] Create `/docs/bugs/bug-[ID]-[name]/fix-strategy.md`
- [ ] Document proposed fix approach and rationale
- [ ] Document implementation plan and timeline
- [ ] Document testing strategy and validation approach
- [ ] Document risks and mitigation strategies

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "bug: add fix strategy and implementation plan for bug [ID]"
```

### **Step 4: Phase 1 Completion & User Approval (Project Manager)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for Phase 1 completion and user approval

## Phase 1 Final Validation:
- [ ] Review bug investigation for completeness
- [ ] Verify root cause is clearly identified
- [ ] Review fix strategy for feasibility and safety
- [ ] Assess implementation timeline and resource requirements
- [ ] Validate testing approach is comprehensive

## User Approval Process:
**What to Present:**
- Complete bug analysis and reproduction steps
- Root cause identification and impact assessment
- Proposed fix strategy and implementation plan
- Testing approach and validation strategy
- Timeline and resource requirements

**Approval Criteria:**
- Bug is clearly understood and reproducible
- Root cause is accurately identified
- Fix strategy is sound and safe
- Testing approach ensures quality
- Timeline is acceptable for bug priority

**If Not Approved:**
- Request specific feedback on analysis or strategy
- Iterate on fix approach based on feedback
- Re-submit revised plan within 1 day
- Document changes and rationale

- [ ] **INVESTIGATION ITERATION**: If not approved, iterate based on feedback
- [ ] **PHASE APPROVAL**: Only proceed to Phase 2 after explicit user approval

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "bug: complete Phase 1 investigation - ready for resolution"
```
