### **Primary Agents**: Developer, QA, Project Manager
### **Duration**: ~1-3 days (depends on complexity)
### **Input**: Complete bug analysis and fix strategy
### **Output**: Bug fix implemented and validated + complete verification documentation

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Bug Fix Implementation (Developer)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Developer** for bug fix implementation

## Fix Implementation:
- [ ] Use Codebase Retrieval to understand current code structure
- [ ] Create fix branch: `bugfix/fix-[ID]-[name]`
- [ ] Read fix strategy from Phase 1 completely
- [ ] Implement TDD approach: Write tests first, then fix
- [ ] Follow fix strategy and implementation plan
- [ ] Make minimal changes necessary to fix the bug
- [ ] Ensure fix doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for the fix
- [ ] Document code changes and rationale

## Testing Implementation:
- [ ] Write unit tests that verify the fix
- [ ] Write integration tests for affected components
- [ ] Write regression tests to prevent bug recurrence
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Verify fix works across all affected environments

## Quality Assurance:
- [ ] Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline is green
- [ ] Test fix in staging environment
- [ ] Document any side effects or additional changes needed

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Fix: Implement bug [ID] resolution"
- [ ] Create task: "Testing: Comprehensive test coverage for fix"
- [ ] Mark tasks as COMPLETE when:
  ‚úÖ Fix implemented and working
  ‚úÖ All tests written and passing
  ‚úÖ No regressions introduced
  ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline green

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "fix: resolve bug [ID] - [brief description of fix]"
- [ ] Verify fix resolves the original bug
- [ ] Verify no new issues introduced
```

### **Step 2: Fix Validation & Testing (QA)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as QA** for bug fix validation and comprehensive testing

## Fix Validation:
- [ ] Verify original bug is completely resolved
- [ ] Test all reproduction scenarios from Phase 1
- [ ] Verify fix works in all affected environments
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Verify error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Test performance impact of the fix

## Regression Testing:
- [ ] Run complete regression test suite
- [ ] Test all related functionality for side effects
- [ ] Verify no existing features are broken
- [ ] Test integration with other system components
- [ ] Verify UI/UX is not negatively impacted (if applicable)

## Comprehensive Testing:
- [ ] Execute all unit tests for affected components
- [ ] Execute integration tests for system components
- [ ] Execute E2E tests for user workflows
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility (if applicable)
- [ ] Test responsive design (if UI fix)
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance (if applicable)

## Documentation:
- [ ] Create `/docs/bugs/bug-[ID]-[name]/verification.md`
- [ ] Document fix validation results
- [ ] Document regression testing results
- [ ] Record any issues found during testing
- [ ] Document test coverage and quality metrics

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Validation: Comprehensive testing of bug fix"
- [ ] Create task: "Regression: Full regression testing"
- [ ] Mark tasks as COMPLETE when:
  ‚úÖ Fix completely validated
  ‚úÖ Regression testing passed
  ‚úÖ All quality gates met
  ‚úÖ Documentation complete

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "test: complete validation for bug [ID] fix - all tests passing"
- [ ] Verify fix is thoroughly tested and validated
- [ ] Verify no regressions or side effects
```

### **Step 3: Bug Resolution Completion (Project Manager)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for bug resolution completion and user approval

## Final Validation:
- [ ] Review fix implementation and testing results
- [ ] Verify original bug is completely resolved
- [ ] Verify no regressions or side effects introduced
- [ ] Test fix in production-like environment
- [ ] Validate fix meets all quality standards
- [ ] Ensure fix is ready for production deployment

## Documentation Consolidation:
- [ ] Create `/docs/bugs/bug-[ID]-[name]/resolution-summary.md`
- [ ] Document complete fix implementation
- [ ] Document testing results and validation
- [ ] Record lessons learned and prevention strategies
- [ ] Document deployment and monitoring plan

## Context Updates:
- [ ] Update `.augment/context/roadmap.md` with bug resolution
- [ ] Update `.augment/context/decisions.md` with fix decisions
- [ ] Document bug resolution in project context

## User Approval Process:
**What to Present:**
- Working fix in staging environment
- Complete validation and testing results
- Fix implementation summary and documentation
- Deployment plan and monitoring strategy

**Approval Criteria:**
- Original bug is completely resolved
- Fix is thoroughly tested and validated
- No regressions or side effects introduced
- Quality standards are maintained
- Ready for production deployment

**If Not Approved:**
- Request specific feedback on fix concerns
- Identify exact issues needing resolution
- Create focused improvement plan
- Re-submit revised fix within 1-2 days
- Document changes and rationale

- [ ] **FIX ITERATION**: If not approved, iterate based on feedback
- [ ] **BUG RESOLUTION**: Mark bug as resolved only after user approval

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Summary: Complete bug resolution documentation"
- [ ] Create task: "Approval: Present bug fix for final approval"
- [ ] Mark all bug fix tasks as COMPLETE when:
  ‚úÖ Fix implementation complete
  ‚úÖ All testing passed
  ‚úÖ Documentation complete
  ‚úÖ User approval received

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "fix: complete bug [ID] resolution - ready for production"
- [ ] Verify bug is fully resolved and validated
- [ ] Verify ready for production deployment
```
