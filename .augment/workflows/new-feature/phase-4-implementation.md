# Augment Develop Method: New Feature - Phase 3: Implementation & Validation

## üéØ Phase Purpose
Story-by-story feature implementation with UI-first approach (if applicable), comprehensive testing, and user approval for feature completion.

## üìç Phase Navigation
- **Previous**: Phase 2 - UI-First Planning (`phase-2-planning.md`) ‚úÖ
- **Current**: Phase 3 - Implementation & Validation üîÑ
- **Next**: Feature Complete (Integrated with System)

---

## üé≠ Phase Coordination

### **Coordinated by**: Project Manager
### **Story Cycle Agents**: Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Project Manager
### **Duration**: Variable (depends on feature scope)
### **Input**: Complete feature plan with hyper-detailed stories
### **Output**: Fully functional feature integrated with existing system + complete verification documentation

## üé® Implementation Strategy

### **UI-First Implementation (if feature involves UI)**:
- **Phase A**: UI Foundation - Components, layouts, navigation
- **Phase B**: Interactive Features - Forms, state management, validation
- **Phase C**: Backend Integration - APIs, data persistence, authentication

### **Backend-First Implementation (if no UI changes)**:
- **Phase A**: Backend Foundation - Data models, business logic, APIs
- **Phase B**: Integration & Testing - System integration, performance, monitoring

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Feature Implementation Setup (Project Manager)**

```markdown
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for feature implementation setup

## Feature Implementation Initialization:
- [ ] Read `.augment/context/mission.md` for project alignment
- [ ] Read `.augment/context/roadmap.md` for current status
- [ ] Create `/docs/features/feature-[ID]-[name]/verification/` directory
- [ ] Load all stories from `/docs/features/feature-[ID]-[name]/stories/`
- [ ] Organize stories by dependencies and implementation phases
- [ ] Verify development environment is ready for feature development
- [ ] Set up feature branch workflow: `feature/[ID]-[name]`

## Implementation Strategy Setup:
- [ ] Plan story execution sequence based on dependencies
- [ ] Identify parallel development opportunities
- [ ] Set up feature-specific testing environment
- [ ] Prepare integration testing with existing system
- [ ] Document feature implementation approach

## Task Management:
- [ ] Create task: "Setup: Initialize feature implementation environment"
- [ ] Create task: "Planning: Organize story execution sequence"
- [ ] Create task for EACH story: "Develop: Story [ID] - [Name]"
- [ ] Update tasks to IN_PROGRESS as development begins

## Quality Gate:
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: initialize feature [ID] implementation - [feature name]"
- [ ] Verify all stories are loaded and understood
- [ ] Verify development environment is ready
- [ ] Verify integration approach is clear
```

### **Step 2: Story-by-Story Development Cycle (Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Project Manager)**

```markdown
## üîÑ FOR EACH STORY in execution order:

üé≠ **Role transitions for each story**: Developer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Project Manager

### Feature Story Development (Developer)
üé≠ **I am acting as Developer** for Feature Story [ID] implementation

- [ ] Use Codebase Retrieval to understand existing patterns and integration points
- [ ] Create feature story branch: `feature/story-[ID]-[name]`
- [ ] Read story file completely: `/docs/features/feature-[ID]-[name]/stories/story-[ID]-[name].md`
- [ ] Implement appropriate TDD approach based on story type:
  - **UI Stories**: UI-first TDD (visual ‚Üí interaction ‚Üí integration)
  - **Backend Stories**: Traditional TDD (unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí E2E)
- [ ] Follow project-specific rules, conventions, and architecture guidelines
- [ ] Use Context7 for framework documentation when needed
- [ ] Focus implementation on story requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Ensure integration with existing system components
- [ ] Make intermediate commits for risky changes or major milestones
- [ ] Use Augment Code checkpoints for complex implementations

### TDD Implementation Process:
1. **Red Phase**: Write tests first (appropriate to story type)
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality and maintainability
4. **Integration**: Ensure feature integrates with existing system
5. **Validation**: Verify story meets all acceptance criteria

### Story Validation (QA)
üé≠ **I am acting as QA** for Feature Story [ID] validation and verification

- [ ] Run all tests for the story (unit, integration, E2E as appropriate)
- [ ] Execute story-specific test scenarios
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Test integration with existing system components
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Validate performance requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance (if UI story)
- [ ] Verify security requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility (if UI story)
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline is green

### Story Verification Documentation (QA)
- [ ] Create `/docs/features/feature-[ID]-[name]/verification/verify-[ID]-[name].md`
- [ ] Document implementation summary and modified files
- [ ] Record test execution results
- [ ] Document integration testing results
- [ ] Note any issues encountered and resolutions
- [ ] Validate story completion against Definition of Done
- [ ] Include screenshots or recordings (if UI story)

### Story Completion (Project Manager)
üé≠ **I am acting as Project Manager** for Story [ID] completion and user approval coordination

- [ ] Review story verification documentation
- [ ] Verify story meets all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test story functionality in staging environment
- [ ] Coordinate user approval for story completion
