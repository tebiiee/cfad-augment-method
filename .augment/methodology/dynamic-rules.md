# Augment Develop Method: Dynamic Rules Creation Protocol

## üéØ Purpose
Protocol for creating project-specific rules during Phase 1 research, building upon the minimal essential rules that apply to all projects.

---

## üìã Core Rules (Always Present)

### Universal Rules (Never Change)
These rules are fundamental to Augment Develop Method methodology and apply to ALL projects:

#### **File Organization**
- Stories: Always in `/docs/current-sprint/stories/`
- Verification: Always in `/docs/current-sprint/verification/`
- Research: Always in `/docs/research/`
- Context: Always in `.augment/context/`

#### **Quality Gates**
- ‚úÖ Tests before implementation (when applicable)
- ‚úÖ Green CI/CD pipeline before proceeding
- ‚úÖ Code review using appropriate agent role
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates

#### **Commit Standards**
- Format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`
- One commit per deliverable/task

#### **Task Management**
- Real-time task state updates
- Dependencies checked before starting
- Blockers documented and escalated

## üîß Dynamic Rules Creation Process

### Phase 1: Rules Analysis & Creation
During technical feasibility research, the Architect agent should:

#### **Step 1: Analyze Project Requirements**
```markdown
## Rules Analysis Checklist:
- [ ] Review existing codebase patterns (if any)
- [ ] Analyze chosen technology stack
- [ ] Identify project-specific constraints
- [ ] Review team preferences from project inputs
- [ ] Consider industry standards for project type
- [ ] Assess security and compliance requirements
```

#### **Step 2: Technology Stack Rules**
```markdown

## üîÑ Rules Integration Process

### During Phase 1 Research
```markdown
## Rules Creation Workflow:
1. **Analyze existing code** and patterns
2. **Research tech stack** best practices
3. **Identify project constraints** and requirements
4. **Create project-specific rules** using templates
5. **Validate rules** with existing code (if any)
6. **Document rules** in `.augment/rules/`
7. **Commit rules** with descriptive message
8. **Update main.md** to reference new rules
```

### Rules File Structure
```
.augment/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.md                    # Universal rules (never change)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-stack.md             # Minimal tech stack rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-style.md             # Basic code style rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ best-practices.md         # General best practices
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-tech-stack.md     # Project-specific tech rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-conventions.md    # Project-specific conventions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-quality.md        # Project-specific quality standards
```

### Rules Validation
```markdown
## Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Rules don't contradict universal rules
- [ ] Rules are specific and actionable
- [ ] Rules align with project requirements
- [ ] Rules are consistent with chosen tech stack
- [ ] Rules include examples where helpful
- [ ] Rules are documented clearly
```

## üéØ Rules Usage Guidelines

### For Agents
1. **Always read main.md** first for universal rules
2. **Load project-specific rules** based on current task
3. **Follow rules consistently** throughout development
4. **Suggest rule updates** when patterns emerge
5. **Document rule violations** and rationale

### For Rule Creation
1. **Build upon universal rules** - don't replace them
2. **Be specific and actionable** - avoid vague guidelines
3. **Include examples** for complex rules
4. **Consider maintainability** - rules should be sustainable
5. **Validate with existing code** - ensure consistency

### For Rule Evolution
1. **Update rules** when patterns change
2. **Document changes** in commit messages
3. **Communicate changes** to team
4. **Archive outdated rules** rather than deleting
5. **Review rules** periodically for relevance

---

## üìä Rules Quality Metrics

### Rule Effectiveness
- **Consistency**: How consistently rules are followed
- **Clarity**: How well rules are understood
- **Completeness**: How well rules cover project needs
- **Maintainability**: How easy rules are to maintain

### Rule Evolution
- **Update Frequency**: How often rules need updates
- **Violation Rate**: How often rules are violated
- **Team Adoption**: How well team follows rules
- **Project Success**: How rules contribute to project success

---

**Remember**: Dynamic rules should enhance, not replace, the universal Augment Develop Method methodology. They provide project-specific guidance while maintaining methodological consistency.
