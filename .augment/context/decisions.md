## ðŸ“š Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
**Date**: [Project Start Date]
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: [Technical Lead, Team]
**Context**: Need to choose primary technology stack for the project

#### Problem Statement
Select a technology stack that balances developer productivity, performance, scalability, and team expertise.

#### Options Considered
1. **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind**
   - Pros: Modern, great DX, strong typing, excellent performance
   - Cons: Learning curve for team, newer ecosystem
2. **React + Create React App + CSS Modules**
   - Pros: Familiar to team, stable ecosystem
   - Cons: More configuration, less optimized
3. **Vue.js + Nuxt + Vuetify**
   - Pros: Gentle learning curve, good documentation
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less team experience

#### Decision
**Chosen**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**: 
- Best performance out of the box with SSR/SSG
- TypeScript provides excellent developer experience and catches errors early
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Team willing to invest in learning modern stack

#### Consequences
**Positive**: 
- Excellent performance and SEO
- Type safety reduces bugs
- Rapid UI development
- Future-proof technology choices

**Negative**: 
- Initial learning curve for team
- More complex build process
- Potential over-engineering for simple features

**Risks**: 
- Team productivity may be slower initially
- Mitigation: Allocate time for learning and pair programming

#### Implementation
- [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Create component library structure

#### Review Date
End of Phase 1 (MVP completion)

### ADR-002: Database and ORM Selection
**Date**: [Date]
**Status**: [Status]
**Deciders**: [Deciders]
**Context**: Need to choose database and data access layer

#### Problem Statement
Select a database solution and ORM that provides good performance, developer experience, and scalability for our use case.

#### Options Considered
1. **PostgreSQL + Prisma**
   - Pros: Excellent TypeScript integration, great migrations, strong typing
   - Cons: Learning curve, potential performance overhead
2. **PostgreSQL + Raw SQL**
   - Pros: Maximum performance, full control
   - Cons: More boilerplate, no type safety, manual migrations
3. **Convex (Serverless)**
   - Pros: Real-time by default, serverless, great DX
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, newer technology, pricing concerns

#### Decision
**Chosen**: [To be decided based on project needs]
**Rationale**: [To be filled when decision is made]

#### Consequences
**Positive**: [To be filled]
**Negative**: [To be filled]
**Risks**: [To be filled]

### ADR-003: Authentication Strategy
**Date**: [Date]
**Status**: [Status]
**Deciders**: [Deciders]
**Context**: Need to implement user authentication and authorization

#### Problem Statement
Choose an authentication solution that is secure, user-friendly, and maintainable.

#### Options Considered
1. **NextAuth.js**
   - Pros: Integrated with Next.js, supports multiple providers, secure defaults
   - Cons: Complex configuration, limited customization
2. **Custom JWT Implementation**
   - Pros: Full control, lightweight
   - Cons: Security risks, more implementation work
3. **Auth0 / Supabase Auth**
   - Pros: Managed service, feature-rich, secure
   - Cons: External dependency, cost, potential vendor lock-in

#### Decision
**Chosen**: [To be decided]
**Rationale**: [To be filled]

## ðŸ”„ Decision Review Process

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review recent decisions for effectiveness
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Discuss impact of decisions on development
- **Major Milestones**: Comprehensive review of all architectural decisions
- **Team Changes**: Review decisions when team composition changes

### Review Criteria
- **Effectiveness**: Is the decision achieving its intended goals?
- **Performance**: Is the performance impact acceptable?
- **Maintainability**: Is the solution maintainable long-term?
- **Team Satisfaction**: Is the team happy with the decision?
- **Business Value**: Is the decision delivering business value?

### Decision Updates
When updating or superseding decisions:
1. **Create new ADR** for the updated decision
2. **Mark old ADR** as "Superseded" with reference to new ADR
3. **Document migration plan** if needed
4. **Update related documentation**
5. **Communicate changes** to all stakeholders

## ðŸš¨ Decision Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- **Significant Impact**: Decision affects multiple components or team members
- **Irreversible**: Decision is difficult or expensive to change later
- **Controversial**: Team has different opinions on the approach
- **Learning**: Decision involves new technology or patterns
- **Compliance**: Decision affects security, performance, or compliance requirements

### Decision Quality Criteria
- **Well-Researched**: Multiple options considered with pros/cons
- **Context-Aware**: Decision considers project constraints and goals
- **Documented Rationale**: Clear explanation of why option was chosen
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues identified with mitigation plans
- **Reviewable**: Decision can be evaluated and updated if needed

### Best Practices
- **Involve Stakeholders**: Include relevant team members in decision process
- **Document Promptly**: Record decisions while context is fresh
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague decisions that can be interpreted differently
- **Consider Future**: Think about long-term implications
- **Learn from Others**: Research how similar projects solved similar problems

## ðŸ“‹ Template Instructions

**For Development Teams**:

1. **Use the template** for all significant architectural decisions
2. **Number ADRs sequentially** (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
3. **Update status** as decisions evolve (Proposed â†’ Accepted â†’ Superseded)
4. **Review regularly** to ensure decisions remain valid
5. **Reference ADRs** in code comments and documentation when relevant

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Implementation based on ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
// Using Next.js API routes for backend functionality
export default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

---

**Remember**: Good architectural decisions are well-documented, reviewable, and help the team understand why the system is built the way it is.
